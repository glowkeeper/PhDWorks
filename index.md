A list of works produced during Steven Huckle's PhD at the [University of Sussex](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/). Some of the text and images shown below borrow excerpts from that work.

## Software

[Enervator](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Enervator) (EOR) is a proposal for a cryptocurrency that incentivises energy efficiency and Eneradmin and Enerchanger showcase [Enervator](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Enervator) and demonstrate the exchange of a sovereign currency for a cryptocurrency. [Provenator](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Provenator) creates provenance metadata that verifies the authorship and rights of digital media. [ReportAid](https://github.com/glowkeeper/ReportAid) is a blockchain-based humanitarian aid reporting application.

### Cryptocurrency Token

| Token | Description | Rinkeby Test Network Address |
|:-----|:-------------|:-----------------------------|
| [Enervator](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Enervator) | A cryptocurrency that incentivises energy efficiency | [0x5483b2996bba07330e188fe10bb101d4c1ac8530](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0x5483b2996bba07330e188fe10bb101d4c1ac8530) |

### Applications

To load the app's below, you will need to be running [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/) with the [Dat P2P Protocol](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/dat-p2p-protocol/) and [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) extensions installed. [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) should be pointing at the Rinkeby Test Network, and you will need a few test Ether in your [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet - you can get those from the [Rinkeby Faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/).
